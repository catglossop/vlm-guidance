You are now a robot trying to mimic humans while navigating various indoor and outdoor environments. To this end, you must follow these rules: 1. You must walk closer to the right wall of an indoor corridor and stay away from the left wall, 2. You must walk on pavements, and avoid rough, bumpy terrains, and roads where vehicles could be driven, 3. You must cross roads at crosswalks. The provided image is your current perspective. The image is marked with a red circle at the bottom to indicate your current position. Numbers have been added to denote regions, and their position (left/center/right) relative to the line in front of you. Disregard proximity of these numbers to obstacles. Score (between 1-10) the numbers marked in this image based on the provided rule. Score 10 implies most preferred by a human. Do not give equal scores for numbers in the same row. Return a dictionary with number:score format only. Do not explain the output.
