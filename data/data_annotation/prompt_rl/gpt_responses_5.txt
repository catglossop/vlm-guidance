Example: recon_tree
Response: Based on the images provided, here is a set of detailed and clear instructions describing the robot's trajectory:

1. **Initial Position:**
   - Start facing the large tree with the building directly behind it.

2. **Move Forward:**
   - Move straight ahead for approximately 2 meters until reaching the tree.

3. **Navigation Around Tree:**
   - Turn slightly left to avoid the base of the tree.
   - Continue to move forward, keeping the tree on your right.

4. **Approach the Building:**
   - Once you pass the tree, adjust your trajectory to the right to head towards the building.

5. **Follow the Path:**
   - Align with the visible path leading alongside the building.
   - Move forward, keeping the building on your right.

6. **Maintaining Direction:**
   - Continue straight, maintaining a safe distance from both the building and any vegetation.

7. **Adjust for Path Clearances:**
   - Watch for obstacles such as bushes or other plants.
   - Make slight adjustments left or right as necessary to maintain a clear path.

8. **Safety Check:**
   - Continuously scan surroundings for unexpected obstacles.
   - Slow down if visibility is reduced or if obstacles are detected.

This sequence ensures that the robot navigates effectively around the tree and towards the building, utilizing clear directions and maintaining awareness of potential obstacles.

Example: sacson_window
Response: Based on the series of egocentric observations, here’s a proposed trajectory for the robot:

1. **Start**: Begin at the initial location facing down the corridor.
   
2. **Move Forward**: Proceed straight for approximately 10 meters. Maintain distance from the left wall with windows (landmark).

3. **Landmark Identification**: Pass by a vent on the floor to the right and a visible patterned wall to the left.

4. **Adjust Course**: As you notice a sign or symbol on the left wall, stay aligned to maintain trajectory.

5. **Continue Forward**: Proceed towards a well-illuminated area with visible changes in floor patterns indicating progress.

6. **Obstacle Check**: Monitor for any unexpected obstructions or changes in the floor surface.

7. **Maintain Direction**: Keep a consistent distance from the right wall, observing the consistent design of panels or structures.

8. **Landmark Verification**: Verify the passing of another vent or floor marking on the right.

9. **Approach End**: Continue moving forward as the corridor opens into a larger space or terminal point.

10. **Stop**: Halt at the entrance of the designated area with open views to the side.

11. **Safety Check**: Perform a sensor sweep to ensure the destination is clear of immediate obstacles.

These instructions aim to provide precise and actionable steps for a robot navigating this environment while accounting for landmarks and safety.

Example: cory_wall
Response: To generate navigation instructions for the robot based on the egocentric observations, I will translate the observed images into a series of detailed and actionable steps:

1. **Start Position:**
   - Observe the flat wall directly in front.

2. **Move Forward:**
   - Advance straight ahead for approximately 3 meters until the wall remains in a consistent position.
   - **Safety Check:** Ensure the path ahead is clear of obstacles such as objects on the ground.

3. **Identify Landmarks:**
   - Note the vertical structure or marking on the wall ahead approximately halfway through the trajectory.
   - Maintain the direction as this serves as a reference point.

4. **Continue Forward:**
   - Proceed until the vertical marking is aligned perpendicularly to your initial position.

5. **Adjust Your Direction:**
   - If needed, slightly adjust trajectory to remain parallel to the wall while continuing forward.

6. **Safety and Environment Check:**
   - Constantly scan surroundings for dynamic obstacles or changes in surface conditions, adjusting speed or direction as necessary.

7. **End of Trajectory:**
   - Continue until reaching a designated endpoint, maintaining awareness of changes or new obstacles.
   - Prepare to stop or continue navigating based on new instructions or observations.

These instructions provide a systematic approach for the robot to follow a clear and controlled path, emphasizing safety and environment awareness.
