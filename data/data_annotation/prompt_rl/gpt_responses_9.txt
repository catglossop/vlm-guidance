Response: To generate a detailed navigation description, I'll use your guideline structure as a reference based on the images you provided, which appear to depict a series of outdoor scenes:

1. **Orientation and Starting Point**:
   - Initial position near a large, distinctive tree with a thick trunk, situated on a well-maintained lawn. The tree is a notable landmark, providing orientation. Nearby, there is a white building with a sloped roof visible in the background.

2. **Directional Movement**:
   - Move forward approximately 4 meters at a moderate speed, keeping the tree on your left as a constant reference point. The path is clear, and the ground is grassy.

3. **Landmark Identification**:
   - Key landmarks include the white building directly ahead and shrubbery near its base. There are additional structures and trees visible to the right and further ahead, providing orientation.

4. **Obstacle Detection and Interaction**:
   - Adjust path slightly to the right to avoid low-hanging branches from the tree. Sensors detect no other immediate obstacles; maintain a straight trajectory.

5. **Safety Checks and Adjustments**:
   - Continuously scan the environment for new obstacles and changes in terrain. Use auditory feedback for proximity alerts, ensuring the path remains clear.

6. **Final Destination**:
   - Stop approximately 2 meters from the buildingâ€™s facade, aligning parallel to it. Confirm placement using the edge of the path and the adjacent shrubs.

7. **Feedback and Error Handling**:
   - Regularly check location against visual markers (e.g., tree, building). If a deviation occurs, recalibrate by re-orienting based on nearby landmarks. Ensure sensors are functioning and providing accurate feedback to maintain course accuracy.

These instructions aim to generate a precise and comprehensive description of the navigation scenario based on the observational data provided from the images.

Example: sacson_window
Response: Certainly! Here's a detailed trajectory description based on the provided images:

1. **Orientation and Starting Point**: Begin at a carpeted hallway with large windows on the left and wooden panels on the right. The view outside includes a landscape and a few distant buildings. Note the position of a rectangular floor vent near a window.

2. **Directional Movement**: Move forward along the hallway, maintaining a steady pace. The windows remain on your left, providing natural light.

3. **Landmark Identification**: Use the repeating pattern of window panes and the wooden panels for orientation. Notice a distinct floor marking slightly ahead, which can be used as a landmark to assess your position.

4. **Obstacle Detection and Interaction**: Be aware of any irregularities in the floor or unexpected items along the path. Use sensors to adjust your path as needed, maintaining a straight course away from walls and windows.

5. **Safety Checks and Adjustments**: Regularly check surroundings for changes in the floor pattern or new obstructions. Make slight adjustments to your trajectory to avoid any obstacles detected by sensors.

6. **Final Destination**: Continue until reaching an area with more visible activity, such as people or additional structures, indicating your endpoint. Stop when you reach a wider space past the hallway, possibly towards a gathering area or waiting zone.

7. **Feedback and Error Handling**: Continuously monitor feedback from sensors to confirm your location against expected landmarks. If a deviation is detected, recalibrate by returning to the last known accurate position and reassessing your path forward.

This sequence provides a structured approach for navigation through the described environment.
