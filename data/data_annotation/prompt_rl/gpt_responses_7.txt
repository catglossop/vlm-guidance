Example: recon_tree
Response: It seems you need a description of a robot's navigation based on a sequence of images. Here's a step-by-step guide that aligns with the setting illustrated in the images:

1. **Initial Position**: Start facing the large tree located in front of a white building.

2. **Move Forward**: Proceed straight ahead towards the tree, maintaining a central alignment with the path between the grass areas.

3. **Approach the Tree**: As you near the tree, prepare to veer slightly left to navigate around it.

4. **Round the Tree**: Begin a soft left turn to bypass the tree, ensuring you maintain a safe distance to avoid collisions.

5. **Adjust Path**: Once past the tree, realign with the building to your right and continue moving forward parallel to its wall.

6. **Identify other Landmarks**: Look for additional structures and pathways to maintain orientation. Use the visible sidewalk as a potential route or reference aid.

7. **Final Steps**: As you move past the tree and continue alongside the building, verify surroundings for safety and potential obstacles.

8. **Pause and Review**: Pause briefly if needed to reassess and confirm the chosen path is clear of obstructions, ensuring navigation accuracy.

These instructions guide the robot using environmental landmarks and clear directional cues.

Example: sacson_window
Response: Based on the images provided, here is a possible step-by-step navigation trajectory for the robot through the corridor:

1. **Start Position**: Begin at the edge of the carpeted corridor, near a window on the left side. Notice a column to the right.

2. **Move Forward**: Proceed straight along the carpeted path, keeping the windows consistently on your left side.

3. **Pass Landmarks**: As you move forward, you will pass a series of repetitive landmarks (such as window frames and columns) on both sides. Maintain a steady pace.

4. **Identify Markers**: Observe any visual markers or signs along the left side by the windows. Use these as reference points for direction.

5. **Adjust Path**: Stay centered in the corridor to avoid veering too close to either the windows on the left or the walls and columns on the right.

6. **Anticipate Turns**: If an opening or doorway appears on the right, slow down to assess if a turn is needed or continue straight if no turn is necessary.

7. **Pause and Check**: Periodically pause to ensure the path ahead is clear of obstacles and to verify your orientation relative to the visible landmarks.

8. **End Position**: Continue moving forward until reaching the specified endpoint or a noticeable change in the corridor structure, such as a different type of flooring or a significant landmark.

These instructions prioritize clarity, detail, and consistency, allowing the robot to navigate effectively through the observed corridor.

Example: sacson_corner
Response: I'm unable to provide a precise trajectory from the image sequence. However, based on a typical environment as seen in the images, here's a general guideline for generating navigation instructions for a robot:

### Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Start**: Begin at the starting point marked by the orange cross on the floor.

2. **Move Forward**: Proceed forward along the carpeted path, maintaining a straight trajectory.

3. **Landmark Observation**: Note the large cardboard boxes on your left as a significant landmark.

4. **Observe Door**: Continue moving until you approach a doorway on the right wall.

5. **Turn Right**: Upon reaching the door, make a 90-degree right turn.

6. **Proceed Straight**: Move straight through the hallway noting the wall markings (possibly safety or directional indicators).

7. **Identify Obstructions**: Watch for any dynamic obstacles (like people moving around).

8. **Move to Open Area**: Continue until you reach an open area with visible windows on the left.

9. **Safety Pause**: Stop briefly to assess for any dynamic changes in the environment.

10. **Proceed to End**: Once clear, proceed forward until you reach the specified endpoint, noticing the bright windowed area further down.

These instructions are hypothetical and would need to be tailored to match the specific goals and constraints in a real-world setting.

3. **Approach the Door**:
   - As you get closer, slow down and prepare to interact with the door handle.

4. **Interact with Door**:
   - Reach and gently push down on the door handle to open.

5. **Check Door Movement**:
   - Ensure the door is fully ajar before proceeding through.

6. **Pass Through Doorway**:
   - Walk straight through the now-open door.

7. **Reassess Environment**:
   - Once past the door, briefly pause to reassess surroundings for any new obstacles or landmarks.

8. **Continue Navigation**:
   - Follow further instructions based on new egocentric observations, moving safely and efficiently.

This sequence is designed to ensure safe and effective passage through the doorway.
