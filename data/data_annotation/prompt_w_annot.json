{ "init_prompt": "A small mobile wheeled robot is moving through an environment and observes the following images with a fisheye camera labelled with their order in the top right corner. Describe each frame in order, using the previous frame as reference when it is not the first frame.",
 "instruct_prompt": "Now, combine the descriptions of each frame as a short clip. Describe the trajectory bsed on the frames in the following formats: 1) 'Move from A to B' or 'Move to B' where A and B are landmarks or structures in the environment. 2) 'Move away from C' where C is a landmark or structure in the environment. 3) 'Move past D' where D is a landmark or structure in the environment. 4) 'Move in a E way' where E captures the manner of movement of the behavior of the robot, specifically the social behavior of the robot. Follow these steps to determine these prompts: 1. If the observations look very similar and the robot is not moving much, change these prompts to reflect that the robot is stationary. 2. If the robot changes direction, meaning it turns left or right, include this detail in the prompt (for example 'Turn right at the door'). 3) Look for strong semantic or social information in the observations. How might a human describe the trajectory if it wanted the robot to execute it? Provide the response in the following format: '([Prompt 1], [Prompt 2], [Prompt 3], [Prompt 4], Reasoning: [Reasoning for each of the prompts]'. Be sure to base your answer of what the robot has observed and not on possible future events or actions. Capture specific objects in the environment and the robot's movement in relation to these objects. If any of the prompt templates do not fit the observed trajectory, return a non-templated prompt that captures the behavior of the robot in the environment and modify the phrasing of the prompt as needed to be more specific and accurate. Thank you!", 
"confidence_prompt": "Are you sure you have captured the behavior in the trajectory? Provide a score of your confidence of each of your response on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is not confident and 5 is very confident. Return the scores as a list and provide your reasoning in the following format: '[score for prompt 1, score for prompt 2, score for prompt 3, score for prompt 4]", 
"redo_prompt": "Rewrite your response for prompts that achieved a score less than or equal to 3. Provide the response in the following format: '([prompt 1, if applicable, otherwise insert the original prompt], [prompt 2, if applicable, otherwise insert the original prompt], [Move past D style prompt, if applicable, otherwise insert the original prompt], [Move in a E way style prompt, if applicable, otherwise insert the original prompt], Reasoning: [Reasoning for each of the prompts]'."
