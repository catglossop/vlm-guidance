{ "init_prompt": "A small mobile wheeled robot is moving through an environment. The first image is its initial observation annotated with the trajectory it follows drawn in blue. The second image is the robot's observation when it has completed the trajectory. What structures and objects are in the environments? Does the robot perform any interesting motions or appear to exhibit any interesting behavior?", 
"instruct_prompt": "Describe the trajectory in the following formats: 1) 'Move from A to B' or 'Move to B' where A and B are landmarks or structures in the environment. 2) 'Move away from C' where C is a landmark or structure in the environment. 3) 'Move past D' where D is a landmark or structure in the environment.  4) 'Move in a E way' where E concisely captures how the robot is moving relative to its environment. Capture any large turns and their direction. Ignore any small adjustments in the trajectory and do not include this in the resulting prompt. Provide the response in the following format: '([Move from A to B style prompt], [Move away from C style prompt], [Move past D style prompt], [Move in a E way style prompt], Reasoning: [Reasoning for each of the prompts]'. Be sure to base your answer of what the robot has observed in the images and not on possible future events or actions. Capture specific objects in the environment and the robot's movement in relation to these objects. If any of the prompt templates do not fit the observed trajectory, return a non-templated prompt that captures the behavior of the robot in the environment.", 
"confidence_prompt": "Are you sure you have captured the behavior in the trajectory? Provide a score of your confidence of each of your response on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is not confident and 5 is very confident. Return the scores as a list and provide your reasoning in the following format: '[score for prompt 1, score for prompt 2, score for prompt 3, score for prompt 4]", 
"redo_prompt": "Rewrite your response for prompts that achieved a score less than or equal to 3. Provide the response in the following format: '([Move from A to B style prompt, if applicable, otherwise insert the original prompt], [Move away from C style prompt, if applicable, otherwise insert the original prompt], [Move past D style prompt, if applicable, otherwise insert the original prompt], [Move in a E way style prompt, if applicable, otherwise insert the original prompt], Reasoning: [Reasoning for each of the prompts]'."
