{ "init_prompt": "A small mobile robot is moving through an environment and observes this environment with a fisheye camera. You will be provided a series of images observed by the robot. Your task is to describe the trajectory of the robot in the environment based on these images. You will be asked to describe the robot's movement in the environment and provide reasoning for your descriptions. Are you ready to start?", 
"instruct_prompt_vlm": "Describe the provided image, noting any objects, structures, people, or other factors that might help the robot localize. Be specific about which objects are close to the robot, which are far and on which side of the field of view they are located.", 
"instruct_prompt_llm": "Here is a list of descriptions of sequential images observed by the robot. Describe the trajectory of the robot in the environment based on these descriptions. Return the description in the form of a json object with the following keys: 'instructions' and 'reasoning'. The 'instructions' key should contain a list of possible instructions that describe the trajectory in the following formats: 1) 'Move from A to B' or 'Move to B' where A and B are landmarks or structures in the environment. 2) 'Move away from C' where C is a landmark or structure in the environment. 3) 'Move past D' where D is a landmark or structure in the environment. 4) 'Move in a E way' where E captures the manner of movement of the behavior of the robot."
